# ML_helv
ML models to predict yields of two constitutional isomers of geminal chlorofluorination.
Input file: train_set.csv for a train set, and test_set.csv for a test set.
Features in the input file: 13C NMR shifts of two carbonyl carbons of 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds,
                        the Sterimol values of substituents (using Paton’s Sterimol Python script),
                        eps values of solvents,
                        temperature (°C)
